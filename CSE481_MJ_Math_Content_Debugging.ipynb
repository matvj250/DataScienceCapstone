Looking for these instances entailed using Python's string.count() method and regex. My main worry was false positives, which I looked for by isolating every type of \"math instance\" and manually going through examples of them in the dataset.\n",

The use of math is likely highly dependent on the CS subfield a paper comes from, and telling a researcher to \"add more/take away math\" from their paper wouldn't be useful to them. However, I believe this notebook still demonstrates my experience in exploratory data analysis, evaluating my methods of extracting data, etc."

For solving the nonsmooth discretized problem, we propose a globally convergent Douglas-Rachford scheme and show that a sequence of dual iterates can be recovered in order to provide a posteriori optimality bounds. In a quantitative comparison to two other first-order methods, the approach shows competitive performance on synthetic and real-world images.

            "(\"Search applications in which queries are dependent on their context are becoming increasingly relevant in today's online applications. For example, the context may be the location of the user in location-aware search or the social network of the query initiator in social-aware search. Processing such queries efficiently is inherently difficult, and requires techniques that go beyond the existing, context-agnostic ones. A promising direction for efficient, online answering -- especially in the case of top-k queries -- is the one of materializing and exploiting results of previous queries (views). We consider in this paper such an approach for query optimization based on cached results, focusing on two important sub-problems. First, the use of precomputed results in context-aware search requires adapted algorithms for top-$k$ query processing, in which only uncertain scores or score ranges are given, instead of exact ones. This is also the case when, for the sake of efficiency, classic top-k algorithms (e.g., NRA) are allowed to stop early - when the final result is reached -- without giving exact scores and ranks within this result. Second, in the presence of cached queries, we need adapted list selection techniques, which can leverage both the descriptions of queries and statistics over their results. We present novel algorithms that address these two problems, and exemplify their use in two important application scenarios: location-aware search and social-aware search. We validate our approaches via extensive experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.\", 1)\n",
            "('An important challenge in the streaming model is to maintain small-space approximations of entrywise functions performed on a matrix that is generated by the outer product of two vectors given as a stream. In other works, streams typically define matrices in a standard way via a sequence of updates, as in the work of Woodruff (2014) and others. We describe the matrix formed by the outer product, and other matrices that do not fall into this category, as implicit matrices. As such, we consider the general problem of computing over such implicit matrices with Hadamard functions, which are functions applied entrywise on a matrix. In this paper, we apply this generalization to provide new techniques for identifying independence between two vectors in the streaming model.

Specifically, several computationally-efficient AS algorithms are developed for two commonly-used NOMA scenarios: fixed power allocation NOMA (F-NOMA) and cognitive radio-inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA). For the F-NOMA system, two novel AS schemes, namely max-max-max AS (A$^3$-AS) and max-min-max AS (AIA-AS), are proposed to maximize the system sum-rate, without and with the consideration of user fairness, respectively. In the CR-NOMA network, a novel AS algorithm, termed maximum-channel-gain-based AS (MCG-AS), is proposed to maximize the achievable rate of the secondary user, under the condition that the primary user's quality of service requirement is satisfied. The asymptotic closed-form expressions of the average sum-rate for A$^3$-AS and AIA-AS and that of the average rate of the secondary user for MCG-AS are derived, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate that the AIA-AS provides better user-fairness, while the A$^3$-AS achieves a near-optimal sum-rate in F-NOMA systems. For the CR-NOMA scenario, MCG-AS achieves a near-optimal performance in a wide SNR regime. Furthermore, all the proposed AS algorithms yield a significant computational complexity reduction, compared to exhaustive search-based counterparts.\", 3)\n",

Sparsity implies that it is faster to apply the resulting matrix; well-behavedness would imply that we do not lose much in stability with respect to the least-squares performance of the MPP. We first address questions of uniqueness and non-zero count of (putative) sparse pseu-doinverses.

In this paper, we study the implementation of SpMV for scale-free matrices on many-core architectures including graphic processing units and Xeon Phi coprocessors. We first propose a hardware oblivious implementation for heterogeneous many-core processors using OpenCL. Our OpenCL implementation uses a novel SpMV format called hybrid COO+CSR (HCC), which employs 2-D jagged partitioning to balance the workload among a large number of cores and improve the data locality. Moreover, the OpenCL implementation is designed to be parametric, which allows systematic performance tuning. We conduct experiments to evaluate the efficiency of our hardware oblivious implementation. Experiments show that it achieves comparable performance to the Intel MKL and state-of-the-art OpenCL-based ViennaCL library implementation. Although the OpenCL implementation provides functional portability for heterogeneous systems, it fails to take advantage of the low-level architectural features. To further improve the performance, we propose a hardware conscious implementation using the native parallel programming language. We use the Xeon Phi platform as a case study. In our hardware conscious implementation, we ensure that the HCC format efficiently utilizes the vector process units on Xeon Phi by employing low-level intrinsics, and improve the overall performance through locality-aware block mapping, and intrablock tiling. Experiments using a wide range of representative scale-free matrices demonstrate that compared with the OpenCL-based hardware oblivious implementation, the hardware conscious implementation achieves  $2.2\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\times }$  speedup on average. Compared with MKL, the hardware conscious implementation achieves  $3.1\\\\boldsymbol {\\\\times }$  speedup on Xeon Phi.', 2)\n",

While there has been a long line of impressive work on understanding such markets in terms of revenue maximizing (also called max-sum) objectives, particularly in the context of allocating online impressions to interested advertisers, fairness considerations have surprisingly not received much attention in online allocation algorithms. Allocations that are inherently fair to participating entities, we believe, will contribute significantly to retaining current participants and attracting new ones in the long run, thereby enhancing the performance of online markets. We give two generic online allocation algorithms to address this problem. In the first algorithm, we address the max-min fairness objective which is defined as the minimum ratio among all advertisers of the actual revenue obtained by the allocation to given target revenues. The second algorithm considers a hybrid objective of max-sum with a revenue penalty for each advertiser who misses her revenue target.

An adaptive TTCM (ATTCM) scheme is employed by the source node during the first transmission period for reliably conveying the source bits to $N$ number of relay nodes by appropriately adjusting the code-rate and modulation mode according to the near-instantaneous channel condition. The TTCM switching thresholds are chosen to ensure that the Bit Error Ratio (BER) at each relay node becomes lower than $10^{-6}$ in order to minimise the potential error propagation imposed by the relay nodes.During the second transmission period, an $N$-antenna assisted Distributed STTC (DSTTC) scheme is created with the aid of the aforementioned $N$ single-antenna relay nodes. More specifically, the $N$ relay nodes are utilised to form STTC codewords based on the re-encoded TTCM symbols of the relays for transmission to the destination node. At the destination node, iterative extrinsic information exchange is performed between the STTC and TTCM decoders for recovering the original source bits.

            "('Abstract The Stone representation theorem was a milestone for the understanding of Boolean algebras. From Stone’s theorem, every Boolean algebra is representable as a field of sets with a topological structure. By means of this, the structural elements of any Boolean algebra, as well as the relations between them, are represented geometrically and can be clearly visualized. It is no different for cylindric algebras: Suppose that ${\\\\frak A}$ is a cylindric algebra and ${\\\\cal S}$ is the Stone space of its Boolean part. (Among the elements of the Boolean part are the diagonal elements.) It is known that with nothing more than a family of equivalence relations on ${\\\\cal S}$ to represent quantifiers, ${\\\\cal S}$ represents the full cylindric structure just as the Stone space alone represents the Boolean structure. ${\\\\cal S}$ with this structure is called a cylindric space. Many assertions about cylindric algebras can be stated in terms of elementary topological properties of ${\\\\cal S}$ . Moreover, points of ${\\\\cal S}$ may be construed as models, and on that construal ${\\\\cal S}$ is called a model space. Certain relations between points on this space turn out to be morphisms between models, and the space of models with these relations hints at the possibility of an “abstract” model theory. With these ideas, a point-set version of model theory is proposed, in the spirit of pointless topology or category theory, in which the central insight is to treat the semantic objects (models) homologously with the corresponding syntactic objects so they reside together in the same space. It is shown that there is a new, purely algebraic way of introducing constants in cylindric algebras, leading to a simplified proof of the representation theorem for locally finite cylindric algebras. Simple rich algebras emerge as homomorphic images of cylindric algebras. The topological version of this theorem is especially interesting: The Stone space of every locally finite cylindric algebra ${\\\\frak A}$ can be partitioned into subspaces which are the Stone spaces of all the simple rich homomorphic images of ${\\\\frak A}$ . Each of these images completely determines a model of ${\\\\frak A}$ , and all denumerable models of ${\\\\frak A}$ appear in this representation.

            "('We introduce the study of forcing sets in mathematical origami. The origami material folds flat along straight line segments called creases, each of which is assigned a folding direction of mountain or valley. A subset $F$ of creases is forcing if the global folding mountain/valley assignment can be deduced from its restriction to $F$. In this paper we focus on one particular class of foldable patterns called Miura-ori, which divide the plane into congruent parallelograms using horizontal lines and zig-zag vertical lines. We develop efficient algorithms for constructing a minimum forcing set of a Miura-ori map, and for deciding whether a given set of creases is forcing or not. We also provide tight bounds on the size of a forcing set, establishing that the standard mountain-valley assignment for the Miura-ori is the one that requires the most creases in its forcing sets. Additionally, given a partial mountain/valley assignment to a subset of creases of a Miura-ori map, we determine whether the assignment domain can be extended to a locally flat-foldable pattern on all the creases. At the heart of our results is a novel correspondence between flat-foldable Miura-ori maps and $3$-colorings of grid graphs.', 3)\n",

We investigate application of different data assimilation techniques in different scenarios to incorporate the available flow measurements obtained from sensors into flow models to improve their accuracy.Water flow in open channels is an instance of the so-called distributed parameters systems in which the dynamics of the system is described by a set of partial differential equations. As the flow model, the Saint-Venant equations, also known as shallow water equations, which are a set of first-order hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations are used. Different practical scenarios are considered. In a case in which streaming measurements of the flow are available and real-time estimation of the flow state is desired, we present how standard state estimation techniques such the Kalman filter, the Extended Kalman filter and the Unscented Kalman filter can be applied to integrate the available measurements into the shallow water equations. It is also shown how these techniques can be adapted to a case in which some of the model parameters are unknown to estimate unkown parameters along with the state of the system.For data assimilation in large-scale networks which lead to high dimensional models, application of two sequential Monte Carlo methods, the optimal sampling importance resampling and the implicit particle filters, is considered. The computational cost of propagating each particle is higher in implicit particle filters, however, they provide more accurate results with smaller number of particles by choosing the particles in a way that they belong to the high probability regions of the posterior density function. We also propose a maximum-a-posteriori-based method to perform the state estimation which is shown to perform better in terms of both accuracy and computational cost for the application of interest. For flow estimation in tidally influenced channels, an efficient estimation method which takes advantage of spectral decomposition of the state is proposed. The estimation problem is formulated as a least squares regression with an $l_1$-norm regularization, known as the LASSO, and a homotopy-based algorithm is implemented to solve the resulting optimization problem recursively as new measurements become available. Finally, we consider the problem of optimal topology design in multi-agent systems for efficient average consensus. The network design problem is posed in two different ways. (1) Assuming that the maximum communication cost, i.e. the maximum number of communication links, is known, the goal is to find the network topology which results in the fastest convergence to the consensus (in presence of communication time delays on the links). (2) If a minimum performance of the protocol is required, the design problem is posed as finding the network with lowest possible communication cost which fulfills the required performance. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem which is finally transformed to a mixed integer semidefinite program.', 1)\n",

            "('A crucial step in the understanding of any phenotype is the correct identification of the signaling pathways that are significantly impacted in that phenotype. However, most current pathway analysis methods produce both false positives as well as false negatives in certain circumstances. We hypothesized that such incorrect results are due to the fact that the existing methods fail to distinguish between the primary dis-regulation of a given gene itself and the effects of signaling coming from upstream. Furthermore, a modern whole-genome experiment performed with a next-generation technology spends a great deal of effort to measure the entire set of 30000–100000 transcripts in the genome. This is followed by the selection of a few hundreds differentially expressed genes, step that literally discards more than 99% of the collected data. We also hypothesized that such a drastic filtering could discard many genes that play crucial roles in the phenotype. We propose a novel topology-based pathway analysis method that identifies significantly impacted pathways using the entire set of measurements, thus allowing the full use of the data provided by NGS techniques. The results obtained on 24 real data sets involving 12 different human diseases, as well as on 8 yeast knock-out data sets show that the proposed method yields significant improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art methods: SPIA, GSEA, and GSA.

In this paper, we propose History-Assisted Adaptive-Granularity Cache (HAAG$) that employs an adaptive caching scheme to support full associativity at various granularities, and an intelligent history-assisted predictor to support a large number of banks in 3D memory systems. By increasing the row-buffer cache hit rate and avoiding unnecessary data caching, HAAG$ significantly reduces memory access latency and dynamic power. Our design works particularly well for manycore CPUs running (irregular) memory intensive applications where memory locality is hard to exploit.

They want to do this with as little communication and as few messages (rounds) as possible. They are willing to use randomization, and fail with a tiny probability. Given a protocol for computing the intersection, it can also be used to compute the exact Jaccard similarity, the rarity, the number of distinct elements, and joins between databases. Computing the intersection is at least as hard as the set disjointness problem, which asks whether the intersection is empty. Formally, in the two-server setting, the players hold subsets S, T ⊆ [n]. In many realistic scenarios, the sizes of S and T are significantly smaller than n, so we impose the constraint that |S|, |T| ≤ k. We study the minimum number of bits the parties need to communicate in order to compute the intersection set S ∩ T, given a certain number r of messages that are allowed to be exchanged. While O(k log (n/k)) bits is achieved trivially and deterministically with a single message, we ask what is possible with more than one message and with randomization. We give a smooth communication/round tradeoff which shows that with O(log* k) rounds, O(k) bits of communication is possible, which improves upon the trivial protocol by an order of magnitude. This is in contrast to other basic problems such as computing the union or symmetric difference, for which Ω(k log(n/k)) bits of communication is required for any number of rounds. For two players, known lower bounds for the easier problem of set disjointness imply our algorithms are optimal up to constant factors in communication and number of rounds. We extend our protocols to $m$-player protocols, obtaining an optimal O(mk) bits of communication with a similarly small number of rounds.', 1)\n",

            "('Given a set of numbers, the $k$-SUM problem asks for a subset of $k$ numbers that sums to zero. When the numbers are integers, the time and space complexity of $k$-SUM is generally studied in the word-RAM model; when the numbers are reals, the complexity is studied in the real-RAM model, and space is measured by the number of reals held in memory at any point. \\nWe present a time and space efficient deterministic self-reduction for the $k$-SUM problem which holds for both models, and has many interesting consequences. To illustrate: \\n* $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2 \\\\lg\\\\lg(n)/\\\\lg(n))$ and space $O\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{n \\\\lg(n)}{\\\\lg\\\\lg(n)}}\\\\right)$. In general, any polylogarithmic-time improvement over quadratic time for $3$-SUM can be converted into an algorithm with an identical time improvement but low space complexity as well. * $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2)$ and space $O(\\\\sqrt n)$, derandomizing an algorithm of Wang. \\n* A popular conjecture states that 3-SUM requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the word-RAM. We show that the 3-SUM Conjecture is in fact equivalent to the (seemingly weaker) conjecture that every $O(n^{.51})$-space algorithm for $3$-SUM requires at least $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the word-RAM. \\n* For $k \\\\ge 4$, $k$-SUM is in deterministic $O(n^{k - 2 + 2/k})$ time and $O(\\\\sqrt{n})$ space.', 19)\n",

            "('Memory reclamation for sequential or lock-based data structures is typically easy. However, memory reclamation for lock-free data structures is a significant challenge. Automatic techniques such as garbage collection are inefficient or use locks, and non-automatic techniques either have high overhead, or do not work for many reasonably simple data structures. For example, subtle problems can arise when hazard pointers, one of the most common non-automatic techniques, are applied to many natural lock-free data structures. Epoch based reclamation (EBR), which is by far the most efficient non-automatic technique, allows the number of unreclaimed objects to grow without bound, because one slow or crashed process can prevent all other processes from reclaiming memory. We develop a more efficient, distributed variant of EBR that solves this problem. It is based on signaling, which is provided by many operating systems, such as Linux and UNIX. Our new scheme takes O(1) amortized steps per high-level operation on the lock-free data structure and O(1) steps in the worst case each time an object is removed from the data structure. At any point, O(mn2) objects are waiting to be freed, where $n$ is the number of processes and m is a small constant for most data structures. Experiments show that our scheme has very low overhead: on average 10%, and at worst 28%, for a balanced binary search tree over many thread counts, operation mixes and contention levels. Our scheme also outperforms a highly efficient implementation of hazard pointers by an average of 75%. Typically, memory reclamation code is tightly woven into lock-free data structure code. To improve modularity and facilitate the comparison of different memory reclamation schemes, we also introduce a highly flexible abstraction. It allows a programmer to easily interchange schemes for reclamation, object pooling, allocation and deallocation with virtually no overhead, by changing a single line of code.', 1)\n",
            "(\"In this paper, a general error analysis is provided for finite-element discretizations of partial differential equations in a saddle-point form with divergence constraint. In particular, this extends upon the work of [J. H. Adler and P. S. Vassilevski, Springer Proc. Math.

            "('Uniform random intersection graphs have received much interest and been used in diverse applications. A uniform random intersection graph with $n$ nodes is constructed as follows: each node selects a set of $K_n$ different items uniformly at random from the same pool of $P_n$ distinct items, and two nodes establish an undirected edge in between if and only if they share at least one item. For such graph denoted by $G(n, K_n, P_n)$, we present the following results in this paper. First, we provide an exact analysis on the probabilities of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ having a perfect matching and having a Hamilton cycle respectively, under $P_n = \\\\omega\\\\big(n (\\\\ln n)^5\\\\big)$ (all asymptotic notation are understood with $n \\\\to \\\\infty$). The analysis reveals that just like ($k$-)connectivity shown in prior work, for both properties of perfect matching containment and Hamilton cycle containment, $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ also exhibits phase transitions: for each property above, as $K_n$ increases, the limit of the probability that $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ has the property increases from $0$ to $1$. Second, we compute the phase transition widths of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ for $k$-connectivity (KC), perfect matching containment (PMC), and Hamilton cycle containment (HCC), respectively. For a graph property $R$ and a positive constant $a < \\\\frac{1}{2}$, with the phase transition width $d_n(R, a)$ defined as the difference between the minimal $K_n$ ensuring $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ having property $R$ with probability at least $1-a$ or $a$, we show for any positive constants $a<\\\\frac{1}{2}$ and $k$: (i) If $P_n=\\\\Omega(n)$ and $P_n=o(n\\\\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)$ is either $0$ or $1$ for each $n$ sufficiently large. (ii) If $P_n=\\\\Theta(n\\\\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)=\\\\Theta(1)$. (iii) If $P_n=\\\\omega(n\\\\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)=\\\\omega(1)$.

Our variant improves the computational complexity at the cost of a moderate increase in memory consumption, but we also improve the computational complexity even when we limit the memory usage to that of Diem's original algorithm.

On his webpage, the late Herbert Wilf posed the problem to find \"any interesting theorems\" about the number f(n) of those partitions. Recently, Fill, Janson and Ward (and independently Kane and Rhoades) determined an asymptotic formula for $\\\\log f(n)$. Since the original motivation for studying Wilf partitions was the fact that the operation that interchanges part sizes and multiplicities is an involution on the set of Wilf partitions, they mentioned as an open problem to determine a similar asymptotic formula for the number of fixed points of this involution, which we denote by F(n). In this short note, we show that the method of Fill, Janson and Ward also applies to F(n). Specifically, we obtain the asymptotic formula $\\\\log F(n) \\\\sim \\\\frac12 \\\\log f(n)$.', 3)\n",

In particular, for every language in P we obtain a delegation scheme with almost linear time verification. Our construction relies on the existence of a computational sub-exponentially secure private information retrieval (PIR) scheme. The proof exploits a curious connection between the problem of computation delegation and the model of multi-prover interactive proofs that are sound against no-signaling (cheating) strategies, a model that was studied in the context of multi-prover interactive proofs with provers that share quantum entanglement, and is motivated by the physical principle that information cannot travel faster than light. For any language computable in time t = t(n), we construct a multi-prover interactive proof (MIP) that is sound against no-signaling strategies, where the running time of the provers is poly(t), the number of provers is polylog(t), and the running time of the verifier is n · polylog(t). In particular, this shows that the class of languages that have polynomial-time MIPs that are sound against no-signaling strategies, is exactly EXP. Previously, this class was only known to contain PSPACE. To convert our MIP into a 1-round delegation scheme, we use the method suggested by Aiello et al (ICALP, 2000).

This introduces a probability of arrangement, keto-amino → enol-imine, where product protons participate in coupled quantum oscillations at frequencies of ~ 1013 s−1 and are entangled. The enzymatic ket for the four G′-C′ coherent protons is │ψ > = α│+ − + − > + β│+ − − + > + γ│− + + − > + δ│− + − + >. Genetic specificities of superposition states are processed quantum mechanically, in an interval ∆t < < 10−13 s, causing an additional entanglement between coherent protons and transcriptase units. The input qubit at G-C sites causes base substitution, whereas coherent states within A-T sites cause deletion. Initially decohered enol and imine G′ and *C isomers are “entanglement-protected” and participate in Topal-Fresco substitution-replication which, in the 2nd round of growth, reintroduces the metastable keto-amino state. Since experimental lifetimes of metastable keto-amino states at 37 °C are ≥ ~3000 y, approximate quantum methods for small times, t < ~100 y, yield the probability, P(t), of keto-amino → enol-imine as Pρ(t) = ½ (γρ/ħ)2 t2.

            "('We consider the inductive inference model of Gold [15]. Suppose we are given a set of functions that are learnable with certain number of mind changes and errors. What properties of these functions are learnable if we allow fewer number of mind changes or errors? In order to answer this question this paper extends the Inductive Inference model introduced by Gold [15]. Another motivation for this extension is to understand and characterize properties that are learnable for a given set of functions. Our extension considers a wide range of properties of function based on their input-output relationship. Two specific properties of functions are studied in this paper. The first property, which we call modality, explores how the output of a function fluctuates. For example, consider a function that predicts the price of a stock. A brokerage company buys and sells stocks very often in a day for its clients with the intent of maximizing their profit. If the company is able predict the trend of the stock market \"reasonably\" accurately then it is bound to be very successful. Identification criterion for this property of a function f is called PREX which predicts if f(x) is equal to, less than or greater than f(x+1) for each x. \\n \\nNext, as opposed to a constant tracking by a brokerage company, an individual investor does not often track dynamic changes in stock values. Instead, the investor would like to move the investment to a less risky option when the investment exceeds or falls below certain threshold. We capture this notion using an identification criterion called TREX that essentially predicts if a function value is at, above, or below a threshold value. Conceptually,modality prediction (i.e., PREX) and threshold prediction (i.e., TREX) are \"easier\" than EX learning. We show that neither the number of errors nor the number of mind-changes can be reduced when we ease the learning criterion from exact learning to learning modality or threshold. We also prove that PREX and TREX are totally different properties to predict. That is, the strategy for a brokerage company may not be a good strategy for individual investor and vice versa.', 2)\n",

            "('A novel approach is plesented to estimate the difference in arrival times of a signal at two senson. \\'& sensor measurements are assumed to be corrupted by spatially correlated Gaussian noises whose covariances are unknown. We propose an optimization approach where the time delay between the two signals is estimated by minimizing a mean fourth cumulant criterion. The proposed criterion is unaffected by the correlated Gaussian noises. It is shown that the criterion yields the vue time delay under the assumption that $e signal is non-Gaussian with non-zero founh cumdant at zero lag. The proposed approach also yields the correct time delay in the presence of spatially independent non-Gaussian noises. Some variarjons of the proposed method are also discussed. Simulations are presented in support of the proposed approach. I. INTRODUCllON The estimation of time delays between received signals at two (or more) sensor locations is an impomt problem in several fields [11-[51.[111.[12] such as sonar, radar, biomedicine, and geophysics. For example, in passive sonar, the time delay is used to estimate the position and the velocity of a detected acoustic source [ I ] Various methods have been proposed and implemented over the years for time delay estimation: see. e.g.. [1]-[5]. The conventional methods based on crosscorrelation techniques [11-[31. 151 do not work well when the noises at the two sensors are correlated 141. To alleviate this problem when the noises are jointly Gaussian and the signal is non-Gaussian, Nikias and Pan 141 recently proposed a novel approach to time delay estimation by exploitation of \"higher-order cross-ctunulants.\" Both parametric and nonparametric approaches were considered In Uus paper u e propose an alternative paramctric approach that alsu rxploils higher.ordcr tulislics of the signal as In (41. hut also w o k s uhcn the noiws arc spatially independent non-Gaussian pmccsrs. unlikc the approach of 141. \\'lhc approach of .41 doeS not offur my optimi?.rtion cntcnun: rather. a cross-iumulmt extension of the usual crurs-conrlanon approach IC proposed in [4].

AS such. our prop.& criterion may k vieued as an Cxtcnsion of the LMS criterion. Hinich et al. 161 have shown via bispectral analysis that whereas the ambient man noise is indeed Gaussian. Ihe ship radiated noise is non-Gaussian. Thus, use of higber-order statistics for time delay estimation in passive sonar is well motivated. The problem at hand can be cast in the framework of a plant (system) identfication problem where signal at one sensor is the (noisy) input and the signal ai the other sensor is the noisy output. The non-standard aspect of the problem lies in the fact that the plant noise is comlated with the input. We can also interpret the given problem in the general framework of enom-in-variables models [IO]. The use of higher-order autoand cross-cumulant spectra for general linear system identification dates back to Akaike [81,[91. More recently, use of higkr-order slatistics for identification of ermrs-invariables models has been suggested by Deistler and Anderson [IOl. To the best of our knowledge. the use of the fourth-cumulant criterion has not been suggested before. The paper is organized as follows. The mathematical model is described in Section 11. The mean fourthcumulant criterion is presented and analyzed in Section Ill. Some extensions of the proposed approach are described and analyzed in Section IV. A simulation example is presented in Section V. II. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS Let (rl(t)) and (rz(t)) denote the two sensor measurements of a (2.1) (2.2) where D is a fixed time delay (advance).

In the example the mass of the structure was optimized with the von Mises equivalent stress as a state param eter. In structural optimization of the vehicle changes in load conditions during their exploitation were taken into account. Since the multilevel FEM analysis of complex 3 -D structures requires a large amount of computational time, Parallel Evolutionary m ethodology was applied to solving this optimization problem. A software package Evolutionary Optimization System (EOS) and FEM analysis ANSYS® program for structure optimization were used. As a result of the optimization the structure mass was considerably reduced. Due to parallel computing the computational time was significantly shortened.

            "('Thanks to Tarek Sayed Ahmed for bringing an important error in [1] to my attention. In the abstract of [1], the fourth displayed equation claims wrongly that “∃ has a winning strategy inH (At(A)) implies A ∈ Ra(CAù)”. Unfortunately, this turns out to be false. This line should be replaced by the weaker claim: “∃ has a winning strategy in H (At(A)) implies there is C ∈ RCAù such that At(RaC ) ∼= At(A).” This weaker claim is already proved in [1, theorem 39]. Two lines down, in the final displayed equation of the abstract, the line “RaRCAã ⊆ K ⊆ ScRaCA5” should be replaced by “ScRaRCAã ⊆ K ⊆ ScRaCA5.” Whether RaRCAù is elementary or not is open. These changes in the abstract require slight changes to theorem 39 and definition 40 and a more substantial change to theorem 45. Theorem 39 should be slightly strengthened as follows. “Let ã ≥ 5, let α be a countable relation algebra atom structure. If ∃ has a winning strategy in H (α) then there is C ∈ RCAã such that Ra(C ) is atomic and AtRa(C ) ∼= α. The proof already shows that C ∈ RCAù and we may extend the result to ordinals ã > ù by redefining Uα to be {f ∈ nodes(Na) : {i < ã : f(i) 6= g(i)} is finite}. In [1, definition 40], the final line “Let A be the complex algebra over α (so the domain consists of arbitrary sets of atoms).” should be replaced by “Let A be the term algebra of α—the countable subalgebra of the complex algebra ofα, generated by α.” Theorem 45 is wrong. The correct statement should be “Let ã ≥ ù and let K be any class of relation algebras such that ScRaCAã ⊆ K ⊆ ScRaCA5. Then K is not closed under elementary subalgebras hence K is not an elementary class.” The proof of this revised theorem can be simplified and completed without the use of the hypernetwork game H . Here, however, we aim to minimise the size of this errata. Accordingly, the corrected proof to theorem 45 is: “Let A be the rainbow algebra of definition 40 and let A A be the countable elementary extension given by lemma 44. Since ∃ has a winning strategy in H (A), by theorem 39 there is C ∈ RCAã such that AtRa(C ) ∼= At(A). Let C ′ ⊇ C be the McNeille completion of C , this is a complete cylindric algebra and AtRa(C ) = AtRa(C ). Then A ⊆c Cm(At(A )) = Ra(C ), by lemma 15, soA ∈ ScRCAã .

Thus Yi =Xi + Zi, Zi-~(0, N). (10.1) The noise Zi is assumed to be independent of the signal Xi. This channel is a good model for some common communication channels. Without further conditions, the capacity of this channel may be infinite. If the noise variance is zero, then the receiver receives the transmitted symbol perfectly. Since X can take on any real value, the channel can transmit an arbitrary real number with no error. If the noise variance is non-zero and there is no constraint on the input, we can choose an infinite subset of inputs arbitrarily far apart, so that they are distinguishable at the output with arbitrarily small probability of error. Such a scheme has an infinite capacity as well. Thus if the noise variance is zero or the input is unconstrained, the capacity of the channel is infinite. The most common limitation on the input is an energy or power constraint. We assume an average power constraint.

            "('Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have emerged to become promising network components for exploiting spectrum opportunistically in order that information can be delivered in circumstances otherwise impossible. Challenging yet open questions are how fast and how far a packet can be delivered in such networks, in temporal and spatial domains, respectively. The answers to these questions offer a straightforward interpretation of the potentials of CRNs for time-sensitive applications. To tackle these questions, we define two metrics, dissemination radius ∥ℒ(t)∥ and propagation speed S(d). The former is the maximum Euclidean distance that a packet can reach in time t, and the latter is the speed that a packet transmits between a source and destination at Euclidean distance d apart, which can be used to measure the transmission delay. Further, we determine the sufficient and necessary conditions under which there exist spatial and temporal limits of information dissemination in CRNs. We find that when information cannot be disseminated to the entire network, the limiting dissemination radius is statistically dominated by an exponential distribution, while the limiting information propagation speed approaches to zero. Otherwise, the dissemination radius approaches to infinity and the propagation speed S(d) is no lower than some constant k for large d. The results are validated through simulations.', 1)\n",

By [{~ we denote the complete digraph of order n such that any two distinct vertices .r and yare joined by two directed edges (x, y) and (y, x). For a digraph G the out degree d+(x) of a vertex x is the number of vertices of G that are adjacent from x and the indegree d(x) is the number of vertices of G adjacent to x. For h 2:: 2, we say that a digraph G is h-connected (resp. h-strongly connected) if either G is a complete digraph [{\\':+1 or else it has at least h + 2 vertices and for any set of vertices X c V(G), IXI h 1, the digraph G X is connected (resp. strongly connected). A connected (resp. strongly connected) digraph is also said to be I-connected (resp. I-strongly connected). For a strongly connected digraph G the distance d( x, y) from vertex x to vertex y is the length of a shortest path of the form (1;, ... , y). The eccentricity of a vertex .r is ecc(x) = maxYEv(G)d(x, y). The diameter of G, denoted Australasian Journal of Combinatorics 24(2001), pp.305-311 d( G) is equal to max:n,YEV(G)d(x, y) if G is strongly connected and 00 otherwise. By Ds(n; h, d = k) and Ds(n; h, d 2 k) (resp.

            "('Linux has seen a lot of new features and developments in the last years in order to accommodate better scalability, interactivity, response time and POSIX compliance. With these changes, Telecom developers began to get serious about using Linux and started porting their systems to it. By doing that they brought new usage models and needs to the community; and among those needs was support for threads, mutual exclusion, priority inversion protection and robust synchronization for mission critical and fault-proof systems on both timesharing and soft real-time environments. This paper describes our experiences trying to meet this need, the current state and where are we headed. We will detail how originally we tried to modify the futex code, but later found we had to abandon that in favor of a similar design based on a layered implementation. This implementation accommodates a kernel and user space locking and synchronization infrastructure that will meet the requirements of those applications needing to use and port complex multithreaded real-time code. 1 A look at the requirements The Carrier Grade Working group, or CGL, was created under the auspices of the OSDL; it provides a meeting point for all parties who share an interest on Linux use for Telecom: network equipment vendors, Linux distributors and developers, carriers, etc. It was in this forum where missing features were identified. Carrier Grade Linux needed good soft real-time 1 features, specially with multi-threaded programs. As well, it needed a common feature provided by Solaris’ mutexes 1For short, we’ll use real-time to refer to soft realtime. 404 • Linux Symposium 2004 • Volume Two that was not present in Linux: robustness . This project was started to provide a kernel synchronization infrastructure ( fusyn) with the indicated characteristics, as well as the proper modifications to the NPTL user space library (RTNPTL) for it to use the new infrastructure and provide the new features. The basic immediate requirements could be summarized in: • The infrastructure should provide the primitives needed by NPTL to support the following POSIX tags: – TPS: thread priority scheduling – TPI: priority inheritance in mutexes – TPP: priority protection in mutexes Or simply: anything that is needed for soft-real time support . • The implementation should support robust mutexes similar to those of Solaris. • The implementation should provide equivalent features at the kernel level for use by drivers and subsystems. With this in mind, we aimed to satisfy the following detailed requirements: 1. mutexes and conditional variables must work according to real-time expectancies (a) All operations (lock, unlock, priority promotion and demotion, etc.) should be deterministic in time, and O(1) when possible (except of course, for waits). (b) The order of lock acquisition by waiters (in mutexes) and wake up (in conditional variables) has to be determined by the scheduling properties of each blocked task/thread. (c) Minimization of priority inversion (given the importance of this item, it will be treated in its own section): i. lock stealing: in SMP systems, during on the acquisition of the lock a lower priority thread can steal the lock from a higher priority thread. ii. when a high priority thread A is waiting for a lower priority owner B to relinquish the mutex and B is preempted by a medium priority thread C. A. priority protection B. priority inheritance 2. Robustness: when a mutex owner dies, the mutex switches to adead-ownerstate and the first waiter gets ownership with a special error code. 3. Uncontested locks/unlocks must happen without kernel intervention. 4. Deadlock detection As well, in order to provide the benefits of this infrastructure to all the levels of a Linux system, it must be possible to use it not only by the user space code, but also by the kernel code. 1.1 The real time expectancies Real-time is all about being deterministic, so all algorithm execution times need to be as predictable or bounded as possible. Using O(1) algorithms helps with this2. 2It is possible to be deterministic with a O(f(N)) operation, as long as f(N) is known; however, in most, if not all, of the cases involving mutex operation, it is highly impractical or plainly impossible to find out f(N), and thus a possibly simpler implementation has to be replaced with one potentially more complex, but O(1). Linux Symposium 2004 • Volume Two • 405 POSIX dictates that upon unlock of a mutex, the scheduling policy shall determine who is the next owner. An obvious way of doing this would be to wake up all of the waiters and let them compete for the lock–the scheduler would determine that the highest priority task would get there first. However, this causes scheduling storms, unnecessary context switches and general avoidable overhead. It is easier and more effective to determine which is the highest priority waiter and only wake that one up. To implement this task in anO(1) way, we need to queue the waiters in a sorted list that provides constant time queuing and unqueuing. On unlock or wake up time, the first waiter in the list will be the highest priority one. 1.2 Priority inversion This condition happens when a lower priority thread blocks a higher priority one. The most general case (Figure 1) is the lower priority thread that holds a resource needed by the higher priority one–a situation that has to be avoided–as much as possible. As indicated before, we aim to solve three different flavors. The first islock stealing. For performance reasons, to avoid the convoy phenomenon 3 [1], the unlockoperation is done by unlocking the mutex and then waking up the first waiter (eg: A). The waiter claims the mutex and then becomes owner. On a single CPU system it can be preempted only by higher priority tasks 4, so lock stealing is not a problem; however, on multiCPU systems, a lower priority task C running on another CPU could claim the lock just be3Summarizing: if task A (high priority) unlocks by transferring ownership to the first waiter B (lower priority), it forces a context switch to B, and if then A recontends for the lock it will create a convoy of waiters that is difficult to dissolve. 4We will use the terms tasks or threads indistinctly to refer to any entity that can acquire a mutex. Figure 1: A case of priority inversion: highpriority task B misses its deadline because lower-priority task A holds for too long a resource it needs, as mid-priority task C preempted it. A lower priority task C blocks a high-priority task B. fore B had the chance to do it and it would create a priority inversion scenario (see Figure 2). The solution to this problem is simple: do not unlock the mutex, just transfer the ownership without unlocking it. We call thiserializedunlock (versusparallel, wake and claim). This method severely limits performance in many cases, because it forces a context switch (causing the already mentioned convoy phenomenon). There has to be a compromise between protection and performance and by offering the option to unlock a mutex in either way, a developer can dynamically adapt according to her needs. The other two cases (of priority inversion) are more complex. They solve the scenario depicted in Figure 1 where task B is waiting for a mutex owned by task A and task C preempts task A. When the priorities are p(B) > p(C) > p(A), we have a priority inversion; task B will miss its deadline because C is blocking A from 406 • Linux Symposium 2004 • Volume Two Figure 2: Low priority task C running on CPU0 steals the lock from higher priority task B running on CPU1. completing its mutex-protected critical section. There are different ways to deal with this problem, but the most common involve bumping up the priority of the owner of the lock to a certain value. In priority protection (or PP), apriority ceiling is determined as part of the design cycle. This is normally the highest of all the priorities among the threads that will share a given mutex; as soon as it is locked, the priority of the owner is raised to match that of the priority ceiling (see Figure 3. When a thread owns many priority-protected mutexes, its priority is that of the highest ceilings. This approach is simple and guaranteed to be trouble free. However, it is laborious; determining the priority ceiling might not be an easy task at all in a moderately complex system where modules from different parties need to interact. Enterpriority inheritance (PI): in this case we Figure 3: Priority protection: task A locks and its priority is promoted to the prioceiling; task C cannot preempt it and it finishes its critical section (and is demoted) in time for B to meet its deadline. have a similar situation, but there is no priority ceiling. What happens in this case is that the priority of the owner is boosted up to that of the highest priority waiter, the first one (see Figure 4). Similarly to the previous case, if a task owns many PI-mutexes, its priority will be the highest of them all. There is no need now to do design-time analysis; the system solves it automatically. Of course, there are drawbacks– it does not come for free. This operation is more expensive, especially in the presence of owner/wait chains 5. The propagation of the priority boost can be long (and will be O(N) on the depth of the chain) and this can lead to unexpected surprises if the interaction across different threads and mutexes in the system is not kept on a tight leash (see [2] and [3]). 5Task A waits for mutex M that is owned by task B that is waiting for mutex N that is owned by task C that is waiting for mutex O. . .

            "(\"Cars, aircraft, mobile cell phones, ships, tanks, and mobile robots all have the common property that they are moving objects. A kinematic representation can be used to describe the location of these objects as a function of time. For example, a moving point can be represented by the linear function p(t) = x0d + (t − t0) va , where x0d is the start location, t0 is the start time, and va is its velocity vector. Instead of storing the location of the object at a given time in a database, the coefficients of the function are stored. When an object's behavior changes enough that the function describing its location is no longer accurate, the function coefficients for the object are updated. Because the objects are represented as a function of time, spatial query results can change even when no transactions update the database. Our hypothesis is that algorithms for the maintenance of spatial queries on kinematic point data types can be developed to support updates to base relations as time advances that are more efficient than straight forward adaptations of previous work. We present algorithms to maintain k-nearest neighbor, spatial join, and spatial semijoin queries in this domain. We compare by experimentation these new algorithms to more straight forward adaptations of previous work to support updates. Experiments are conducted using synthetic uniformly distributed data, and real aircraft flight data. The primary metric of comparison is the number of I/O disk accesses needed to maintain the query results and supporting data structures. A system to query and visualize results on moving object data, in a client-server environment, is also presented. The work presented here is built upon a culmination of our previously published work, including work on continuously moving point queries [35, 36], and client-server systems [31, 33, 34].\", 1)\n",

            "('Discusses the symbol synchronizer performance of a fully digitally implemented receiver, operating on a narrowband M-PSK signal (one-sided bandwidth not exceeding the symbol rate). The considered digital receiver operates on samples of the complex envelope r(t) of the received signal, taken by a fixed clock which is not synchronized to the transmitter clock. The synchronized samples required for the symbol synchronization algorithm are computed by interpolating between the available non-synchronized samples. Because of finite memory, interpolation is non-ideal; hence, some amount of distortion is introduced, which affects the performance of the symbol synchronizer. By means of theoretical analysis, the authors investigate the tracking performance of a specific decision-directed feedback synchronizer, assuming interpolation of orders zero, one and two. They show that non-ideal interpolation gives rise to a loop noise spectrum containing spectral lines, that mainly occur near f=0 when the number of samples per symbol is close to an integer. Unless a sufficiently small loop bandwidth is chosen, the contribution of these spectral lines could dominate the timing error variance, which then becomes much larger than for synchronized sampling.<<ETX>>', 1)\n",
            "('Abstract : This paper presents a numerical method to rapidly determine the rise- set times of satellite-satellite and satellite ground station visibility periods, with the line-of-sight corrected for an oblate Earth. The algorithm uses space curve modeling technique known as parabolic blending to construct the waveform of the visibility function, psi (t), versus time. The waveform is produced from either uniform or arbitrarily spaced abscissa points, from which rise-set times are obtained by extracting the real roots of a localized cubic polynomial. This algorithm works for all orbital eccentricities and perturbed satellite motion, provided the visibility function, psi(t), does not become discontinuous as it could from thrusting or deploying a tether. For this study, the rise-set truth table is constructed using a standard five second step-by- step integration with a linear interpolator to locate the exact crossing times. ne simulation results from this algorithm are almost identical to those obtained by modeling satellites subject to first order secular perturbations caused by mass anomalies, but generated in considerably less time.

To justify this inclusion, it has been shown previously that, by using a particular set of one-dimensional slices on the fourth-order moments space and an appropriately defined 'covariance-type' estimator, this moments sequence retains the same damped complex exponential structure as signal r(t), thus only containing the natural resonances of the unknown target. Simulation results clearly show that significant improvements are achieved by using the fourth-order moments sequence of r(t) as the unknown-target signature, instead of the original signal r(t) in the E-pulse discrimination scheme.

Unlike in traditional online scheduling problems, where a job's placement is immutable, in reallocation problems the schedule may be adjusted, but at some cost. The goal is to maintain an approximately optimal schedule while also minimizing the reallocation cost for changing the schedule. This paper gives a reallocating scheduler for the problem of assigning jobs to p (identical) servers so as to minimize the sum of completion times to within a constant factor of optimal, with an amortized reallocation cost for a length-w job of O(f(w)log3logΔ), where Delta is the length of the longest job and f() is the reallocation-cost function. Our algorithm is cost oblivious, meaning that the algorithm is not parameterized by f(), yet it achieves this bound for any subadditive f(). Whenever f() is strongly subadditive, the reallocation cost becomes O(f(w)). To realize a reallocating scheduler with low reallocation cost, we design a k-cursor sparse table. This data structure stores a dynamic set of elements in an array, with insertions and deletions restricted to k cursors in the structure. The data structure achieves an amortized cost of O(log3 k) for insertions and deletions, while also guaranteeing that any prefix of the array has constant density.

In a 2013 monograph, they introduce the idea of anonymous guessing strategies, in which the agents can see the past but don't know where they are located in time. In this paper, we consider a number of variations on anonymity.

The reader can refer to [3] for the basic theory, algorithms andapplications.The primal-dual IPM for linear optimization(LO) problem was rst intro-duced in [5] and [9]. They analyzed the polynomial complexity of the algorithm.Later on, Kojima et al. generalized their algorithms to monotone LCPs([7]),i.e. P(0) LCPs and to P(\\x14) LCPs([6]). Since then an interior point algo-rithm’s quality is measured by the fact whether it can be generalized to P(\\x14)LCPs or not([4]). Most of polynomial time interior point algorithms are basedon the logarithmic barrier functions, e.g. see [12] . Peng et al.([11]) intro-duced self-regular barrier functions and obtained the best complexity result forlarge-update primal-dual IPMs for LO with some speci c self regular barrierfunction.

The negative decision number of G, introduced by Wang, is the maximum value of ∑ v∈V f(v) taken over all bad functions of G. In this paper, we comprehensively study the negative decision number from algorithmic, complexity, and graph-theoretic points of view. Our main results are as follows. 1. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute the negative decision number of a given graph, even if the graph is bipartite. Moreover, it is NP-complete to decide whether the negative decision number of a given bipartite graph is at least k, where k is any fixed integer (not necessarily positive). On the other hand, we show that the negative decision number can be computed in polynomial time for several special classes of graphs including trees. 2. For a below-upper-bound formulation of the problem of computing the negative decision number, we show an asymptotically tight approximation threshold of Θ(log |V |). Specifically, it can be approximated within a factor of O(log |V |) in polynomial time, but cannot be approximated better than c log |V | for some constant c > 0 unless NP⊆ DTIME(n log ). 3.

            "('Ordered fuzzy numbers as generalization of convex fuzzy numbers are defined together with four algebraic operations. For defuzzification operators, that play the main role when dealing with fuzzy controllers and fuzzy inference systems, new representation formulae are given. Step ordered fuzzy numbers are considered. Approximation method based on forward neural networks is presented for determining defuzzification functionals when training sets of data are given. Results of approximation are given. FUZZY NUMBERS Fuzzy numbers (Zadeh, 1965) are very special fuzzy sets defined on the universe of all real numbers R. In applications the so-called (L,R)–numbers proposed by Dubois and Prade (Dubois & Prade, 1978) as a restricted class of membership functions, are often in use. In most cases one assumes that membership function of a fuzzy number A satisfies convexity assumptions (Nguyen, 1978). However, even in the case of convex fuzzy numbers (CFN) multiply operations are leading to the large grow of the fuzziness, and depend on the order of operations. This as well as other drawbacks have forced us to think about some generalization. Number of attempts to introduce non-standard operations on fuzzy numbers has been made (Drewniak, 2001; Klir, 1997; Sanschez, 1984; Wagenknecht, 2001). Our main observation made in (Kosinski et.al., 2002a) was: a kind of quasi-invertibility (or quasi-convexity (Martos, 1975)) of membership functions is crucial. Invertibility of membership functions of convex fuzzy number A makes it possible to define two functions a1, a2 on [0, 1] that give lower and upper bounds of each α-cut of the membership function μA of the number A A[α] = {x : μA(x) ≥ α} = [a1(α), a2(α)] with a1(α) = μA| incr(α) and a2(α) = μA| −1 decr(α) , where |incr and |decr denote the restrictions of the function μA to its sub-domains on which is increasing or decreasing, respectively. Both functions a1(α), a2(α) were used for the first time by the authors of (Goetschel & Voxman, 1986) in their parametric representation of fuzzy numbers, they also introduced a linear structure to convex fuzzy numbers. ORDERED FUZZY NUMBERS In the series of papers (Kosinski et.al., 2002a; Kosinski et. al., 2003b,a) we have introduced and then developed main concepts of the space of ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs). In our approach the concept of membership functions has been weakened by requiring a mere membership relation . Definition 1. Pair (f, g) of continuous functions such that f, g : [0, 1]→R is called ordered fuzzy number A. Notice that f and g need not be inverse functions of some membership function. If, however, f is increasing and g – decreasing, both on the unit interval I , and f ≤ g, then one can attach to this pair a continuous function μ and regard it as a membership function a convex fuzzy number with an extra feature, namely the orientation of the number. This attachment can be done by the formula f−1 = μ|incr and g−1 = μ|decr. Notice that pairs (f, g) and (g, f) represent two different ordered fuzzy numbers, unless f = g . They differ by their orientations. Definition 2. Let A = (fA, gA), B = (fB , gB) and C = (fC , gC) are mathematical objects called ordered fuzzy numbers. The sum C = A+B, subtraction C = A−B, product C = A ·B, and division C = A÷B are defined by formula fC(y) = fA(y) ? fB(y) , gC(y) = gA(y) ? gB(y) (1) where ”?” works for ”+”, ”−”, ”·”, and ”÷”, respectively, and where A ÷ B is defined, if the functions |fB | and |gB | are bigger than zero. Scalar multiplication by real r ∈ R is defined as r · A = (rfA, rgA) . The subtraction of B is the same as the addition of the opposite of B, and consequently B − B = 0, where 0 ∈ R is the crisp zero. It means that subtraction is not compatible with the the extension Proceedings 25th European Conference on Modelling and Simulation ©ECMS Tadeusz Burczynski, Joanna Kolodziej Aleksander Byrski, Marco Carvalho (Editors) ISBN: 978-0-9564944-2-9 / ISBN: 978-0-9564944-3-6 (CD) principle, if we confine OFNs to CFN. However, the addition operation is compatible, if its components have the same orientations. Notice, however, that addition, as well as subtraction, of two OFNs that are represented by affine functions and possess classical membership functions may lead to result which may not possess its membership functions (in general f(1) needs not be less than g(1)). Relation of partial ordering in the spaceR of all OFN, can be introduced by defining the subset of positive ordered fuzzy numbers: a number A = (f, g) is not less than zero, and write A ≥ 0 if f ≥ 0, g ≥ 0 , andA ≥ B ifA−B ≥ 0 . (2) In this way the spaceR becomes a partially ordered ring. Neutral element of addition in R is a pair of constant function equal to crisp zero. Operations introduced in the space R of all ordered fuzzy numbers (OFN) make it an algebra, which can be equipped with a sup norm ||A|| = max(sup s∈I |fA(s)|, sup s∈I |gA(s)|) if A = (fA, gA) . In R any algebraic equationA+X = C forX , with arbitrarily given fuzzy numbers A and C, can be solved. Moreover, R becomes a Banach space, isomorphic to a Cartesian product of C(0, 1) the space of continuous functions on [0, 1]. It is also a Banach algebra with unity: the multiplication has a neutral element the pair of two constant functions equal to one, i.e. the crisp one. Some interpretations of the concepts of OFN have been given in (Kosinski et.al., 2009a). Fuzzy implications within OFN are presented in (Kosinski et. al., 2009b). STEP NUMBERS It is worthwhile to point out that the class of ordered fuzzy numbers (OFNs) represents the whole class of convex fuzzy numbers with continuous membership functions. To include all CFN with piecewise continuous membership functions more general class of functions f and g in Def.1 is needed. This has been already done by the first author who in (Kosinski, 2006) assumed they are functions of bounded variation. The new space is denoted by RBV . Then operations on elements of RBV are defined in the similar way, the norm, however, will change into the norm of the Cartesian product of the space of functions of bounded variations (BV). Then all convex fuzzy numbers are contained in this new space RBV of OFN. Notice that functions from BV (Łojasiewicz, 1973) are continuous except for a countable numbers of points. Important consequence of this generalization is the possibility of introducing the subspace of OFN composed of pairs of step functions. It will be done as follows. If we fix a natural number K and split [0, 1) into K − 1 subintervals [ai, ai+1) , i = 1, 2, ...,K, i.e. K−1 ⋃ i=1 [ai, ai+1) = [0, 1), where 0 = a1 < a2 < ... < aK = 1, we may define step function f of resolution K by putting value f(s) = ui ∈ R, for s ∈ [ai, ai+1), then each such function f can be identified with a Kdimensional vector f ∼ u = (u1, u2...uK) ∈ R , the K-th value uK corresponds to s = 1, i.e. f(1) = uK . Taking pair of such functions we have an ordered fuzzy number fromRBV . Now we introduce Definition 3. By step ordered fuzzy number A of resolution K we mean ordered pair (f, g) of functions such that f, g : [0, 1]→R are K-step function. We use RK for denotation the set of elements satisfying Def. 3. The set RK ⊂ RBV has been extensively elaborated by our students in (Gruszczynska & Krejewska, 2008) and (Kościenski, 2010). We can identify RK with the Cartesian product of R × R since each Kstep function is represented by its K values. It is obvious that each element of the space RK may be regarded as approximation of elements fromRBV , by increasing the number K of steps we are getting the better approximation. The norm of RK is assumed to be the Euclidean one of R , then we have a inner-product structure for our disposal. DEFUZZIFICATION FUNCTIONALS In the course of defuzzification operation in CFN to a membership function a real, crisp number is attached. We know number of defuzzification procedures from the literature (Van Leekwijck & Kerre, 1999). Continuous, linear functionals on R give the class of defuzzification functionals . Each of them, say φ, has the representation by the sum of two Stieltjes integrals with respect to two functions h1, h2 of bounded variation,', 3)\n",

            "('The recent financial crisis has shown that most market risk models – even if they deliver sufficiently accurate risk figures over short time horizons – are not able to provide reliable forecasts for risk figures over longer time horizons like three, twelve or 36 months, which are the basis for both limit management and economic capital planning. As a potential remedy the concept of p tential future market riskcan be used to deal with such long term model risks in market risk measurement. Based on a toy example we will outline how this concept can be applied for new business planning or for limit setting and capital buffer definitions. 1 DEFINITION OF MODEL RISK In the context of market risk measurement, model risk is usually understood as the risk that the model used for market risk measurement is specified wrongly and does therefore not or not fully capture the risks it was designed to measure (Jorion, 2007), Section 21.2.6. In the following, however, we focus on a different point of view along the lines of (Jorion, 2007), Chapter 9, and thus we need to distinguish between different kinds of model risk. Short Term Model Risk. Short term model risk arises from the fact that model assumptions may be violated, which also includes parameter uncertainty (i.e. estimation risk). Taking the example of a delta-normal VaR model, the linear impact of risk factor changes on the portfolio value as well as the normal distribution assumption with constant volatility for risk factor changes are such assumptions. Short term model risk is usually an issue for the daily risk measurement process, see for example (Figlewski, 2003) or (Hendricks, 1996). (Berkowitz and OBrien, 2002) analyse the accuracy of VaR forecasts for banks’ trading desks based on the models used in practice. There is vast literature on how short term model risk can be identified and controlled via back-testing procedures, see e.g. (Kupiec, 1995), (Christoffersen et al., 2001), (Christoffersen and Pelletier, 2004) or more recently (Berkowitz et al., 2011); or how it can be handled via more sophisticated models, see for instance (Kamdem, 2005) for an extension to elliptical distributions, (Alexander, 2001) for a non-parametric linear historical or Monte-Carlo VaR or (Bams and Wielhouwer, 2001) for adjustment factors for estimation risk. (Alexander and Sarabia, 2011) quantify VaR model risk and derive an add-on factor for market risk capital. Similarly, (Kerkhof et al., 2010) derive an add-on to capital reserves which accounts for VaR model risk and distinguishes between estimation and misspecification risk. Long Term Model Risk. This kind of model risk covers the risk that the reported daily risk figures change in an adverse fashion over longer time scales, although the portfolio itself remains unchanged. This means that even if the risk is reasonably measured and predicted for small time horizons by the model, the market risk number might change on a daily basis and, therefore, cannot be used for longer term planning. Delta-normal VaR figures, for example, are highly impacted by (i) changing volatilities and correlations, and (ii) changing portfolio sensitivities. Before the beginning of the financial crisis, long term model risk was not considered to be an issue for banks or financial institutions 1, as any unwanted shift or increase in VaR figures could be easily countered by hedging or risk reduction actions. Since the second half of 2007, however, significant parts of trading 1As one of a few exceptions, let us mention the expositions by (Jorion, 2007), Section 9.5 or (Danielsson, 2002), who point out that VaR figures are volatile and not reliable in general. 239 Spangler M. and Werner R.. COPING WITH LONG TERM MODEL RISK IN MARKET RISK MODELS. DOI: 10.5220/0003712902390246 In Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES-2012), pages 239-246 ISBN: 978-989-8425-97-3 Copyright c 2012 SCITEPRESS (Science and Technology Publications, Lda.) portfolios became more and more illiquid, risks could no longer be hedged adequately, and risk figures increased in an unpredicted fast and threatening fashion. Potential consequences were limit breaches, or in worst case situations, additional capital requirements to keep the financial institution solvent. In the following, we therefore discuss long term model risk only, with a special focus on the implications for limit management and economic capital planning. As long term model risk is a rather novel issue, there is not much literature available. (Christoffersen and Goncalves, 2005) or (Jorion, 1996), who investigate the statistical properties of VaR figures in detail, propose confidence intervals around VaR estimates to cover model risk. Their expositions are, however, mainly centred around short term model risk. To quantify long term model risk we are more interested in the extent to which VaR figures may change in future. Therefore, we need to take into account potential future evolutions of market environments. Taking the ideas by Christoffersen, Goncalves and Jorion further, this immediately leads to the concept of potential future value-at-risk(PFVaR), developed by (Spangler and Werner, 2010). There, a detailed explanation of the concept is given together with a specific example on the computation of the corresponding risk figures. Here, we briefly recall the main definitions of PFVaR from (Spangler and Werner, 2010), before we focus on the application of the concept in risk management. 2 THE CONCEPT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE VALUE-AT-RISK For the proper definition of PFVaR, let us fix a static portfolio, a reference time tR (i.e. today) and let us denote the future (random) VaR figure at time t > tR with VaRα (t) for a given VaR level α.2 Similarly to the potential future exposure concept in counterparty credit risk (see (Pykhtin, 2005) for more details), a few versions of PFVaR have been introduced by Spangler and Werner: • Theexpected VaRat timeT > tR is the average of the potential future VaR at time T: EVaRα (T) := E [VaRα (T) |F tR] . (1) • Thepeak VaRat timeT > tR is the maximum VaR that is expected to occur at time T at a given confidence level (quantile) β ∈ (0,1): PVaRα,β (T) := qβ [VaRα (T) |F tR] . (2) 2As the VaR time horizonh is fixed throughout the following, we skip it for notational convenience. • The maximum peak VaRuntil time T > tR is the maximum VaR that is expected to occur in [tR,T] at a given confidence level β ∈ (0,1): MPVaRα,β (T) := qβ ( max t∈[tR,T] [VaRα (t) |F tR] )', 2)\n",
            "('At present,traditional Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM ) technique has been widely used in the variable frequency speed control system,but this technique makes the system produce components of high harmonic wave at integer times of switching frequency.Thus inverter produces conducted Electromagnetic Interference (EMI ) and high frequency noise.Faced with these problems,this paper adopts the method which is to add two-state or three-state Markov chain technique to variable frequency speed control system of SVPWM generator to reduce high frequency noise.This method can make amplitude of harmonic components of output current that is produced by inverter of the system effective in reducing and more uniformly distribute in relatively wide frequency range.Through many simulation experiments,this method can effectively reduce amplitude of harmonic components and is more superior than traditional SVPWM technique. Introduction Traditional SVPWM technique makes a qualitative leap in variable-frequency speed control technique,but application of traditional SVPWM technique also brings some new problems[1].For example,switching devices of traditional SVPWM technique are turned on and shut off in a certain way,but components of high harmonic wave are produced in the integer times of switching frequency (especially one multiple and two multiple).High harmonic wave led electromagnetic induction motor of system to create a problem which is the high frequency electromagnetic noise. Regarding of this class of problems, researchers had put forward a method that is random SVPWM technique.Although the method can effectively reduce high harmonic wave,makes equipment structure become simple and effective,can be simply implement,etc[2].But this method also has some problems in real application.Generation of random numbers is basis to implement the random SVPWM technique.Random numbers should absolutely obey uniform distribution in its ideal sense,but it would inevitably produce a phenomenon that continuous multiple random numbers are greater than mathematical expectation or less than mathematical expectation.This phenomenon can make amplitude of high harmonic wave still maintain very high in integral times of switching frequency and cannot be effectively suppressed,so that this method also can increase output ripple current and influence on the control performance of system[3,4]. In view of above problems,the paper putted forward a method that Markov chain technique is applied to SVPWM generator model.Thus the method can make harmonic wave of output current more uniformly distribute in relatively wide frequency range,effectively restrain high frequency noise,make output current waveform become more perfect and reduce ripple current.So that experimental results demonstrate that infinite state Markov chain technique is feasibility and advantage.

            "('Advances in information technology have provided the infrastructure to collect huge amounts of business data from many different sources: customers, suppliers, competitors, patents, products, and technical support. As a result of the amount of collected data there is an increasing need for better mechanisms for automated data analysis and decision support. Data-mining researches and tool builders have addressed the challenge of automated data analysis, but so far have focused on algorithms that apply to feature-vector representations (single tables). Despite significant efforts in the development and improvement of data warehousing systems and on-line analytical processing (OLAP), we feel that the support of the analysis of data in relational format is insufficient. This work investigates approaches to automated analysis of relational data and develops a modular data-mining approach for noisy business applications. Introduction and Motivation Machine-learning research has developed a number of automated data-mining tools, many which have found successful application in business domains. Most of these modeling techniques require a feature-vector input representation: examples are given as a (single) table of fixed-length feature vectors (x1, x2, x3, x4,\\x85, xn). In contrast, a relational representation consists of multiple tables instead of just one. A simple feature-vector representation is fundamentally unsuitable for most business domains, which are characterized by transaction and interaction data. Transaction data conventionally are stored in a multi-table relational database, where each customer has a number of transactions. The example below shows two simplified tables that capture customer and transaction information and link the information via the key CustomerId. Name CustomerID City Birth Group Smith 1092323 Boston 1973 A Transaction ID CustomerID Date Price Payment 9238192346192 1092323 3/12/02 87.78 Visa Each transaction involves a product that might be related to other products. The probability of buying product X (for example a battery for IBM Thinkpad T22) might depend on its relationship to product Y (IBM Thinkpad T22) that the customer bought 4 weeks ago. The relational nature of customer data makes traditional analysis tools suboptimal for customer preference and behavior modeling. Similar arguments hold for business intelligence applications involving general business relationships, alliances, and technological dependencies.

Structural concepts and relationships between objects are difficult to represent using a non-relational model. \\x95 Integration of background knowledge. Domain knowledge can be encoded and given as explicit background knowledge. The use of background knowledge has been linked for instance by Aronis et al. (1996) to performance improvement. The source of the background knowledge can be a database, or an expert. Traditionally a human expert had to identify important background factors that can be used for modeling. But in many cases expert knowledge on a general problem class is limited and the number of possible features is almost infinite. We propose to evaluate approaches to relational learning and develop new methods to improve the performance and the degree of automation. We are particularly interested in classification and the estimation of the probability of class membership. The next section presents a novel framework for relational classification and gives an overview of existing approaches. Perlich & Foster/Modular Approach to Relational Data Mining 2002 \\x97 Eighth Americas Conference on Information Systems 73 A Modular Framework of Relational Data Mining Relational data-mining approaches can be classified into two main categories. The objective of the first is to build a relational model in the form of first-order-logic rules directly from relational data. Such a rule could be the following: Buy(Customer,P1)←Bought(Customer,P2) AND BatteryOf(P2,P1). This rule predicts that Customer will buy product P1 if P1 is the battery of a product that he bought before. Alternatively relational data mining can be achieved by first transforming the relational data into a feature-vector representation followed by the application of a standard technique such as decision-tree induction or logistic regression to learn a predictive model. DeRaedt (1998) demonstrated that it is only possible in special cases to convert relational data into a propositional format without loss of information, and that the resulting feature space is exponential in the number of parameters. However, the objective of feature construction is not to perform a complete transformation, but rather to construct a small but relevant set of features from the relational background\\x97features that capture the relational information for the learning task. We will refer to the former approach as direct relational learning and to the later as the feature-construction approach. We argue that the feature-construction approach has several advantages: \\x95 Standard (\\x93propositional\\x94) learning techniques are numerous and substantially more mature than relational learning techniques. The feature-construction approach allows this maturity to \\x93solve\\x94 a large part of the relational learning problem. \\x95 The freedom of choice of a propositional learner allows different behavior depending on the learning objective (classification, probability estimation, interpretation, etc.), using the same data. \\x95 The modularity of the approach simplifies the choice of system parameters by a domain expert (see below), and the addition of expert-suggested transformations. \\x95 The run-time behavior can be adjusted by adding or subtracting constraints on aggregation and number of features. A Modular Approach to Feature Construction from Relational Data The relational nature of the input format manifests itself in two forms: set-valued attributes and structural connections (via keys) between relations. For instance, in order to classify customers in the given example based on their previous transactions, every customer has to be linked to his transaction via a join over both tables. Feature construction from relations can be framed as a three-step procedure. The first exploration step is the joining of the target relation with background relations. The second step is the aggregation of multiple values per target entry using aggregation operators based on the type of the value (e.g., mean for numeric values like price). The last step is the assessment of the quality of the feature with respect to the classification task, for example (simply) via the application of a threshold to a simple measure like correlation for numeric values or purity for categorical values. This framework is very general and can be instantiated with different exploration strategies, aggregation methods, featureselection heuristics, and stopping criteria.', 1)\n",

The idea is to implicitly convert the local- minima-laden cost function f((DOT)) into a sequence of its smoothed versions {f(beta t)}Ttequals1, which, subject to the parameter (beta) t, bears less details at time t equals 1 and gradually more later on, the learning is actually performed on this sequence of functionals. The corresponding smoothed global minima obtained in this way, {Wt}Ttequals1, thus progressively approximate W--the desired global minimum.

            "(\"We construct a method of time warping in quasiperiodic time series analysis using genetic algorithm in order to extract the instantaneous phase difference between a template signal and a testing signal. Contrast to previous studies, which involves correlation estimations to determine the shape similarity of two signals taken from the quasiperiodic time series, time warping perform the comparison of the two signals by first constructing a discrete set of M points formed from uniformly sampled values of the template signal f(t). The discrete set of sample values of the testing signal, g(t'), which contains N points, will be interpolated to form a continuous function so that the difference between the template signal at those M points and the corresponding testing signals are minimize to best preserve the mapping of the two signals. The result of this optimization procedure produces a phase shift function that relates the time t' in the testing signal to the time t in the template signal. Due to the numerous choices in the partitioning of the time domain of the two signals, genetic algorithm is found to be effective in extracting this phase shift function. We apply this theoretical tool of time warping using genetic algorithm to analyze the electrocardiographic (ECG) signals, with the aim to investigate if central apneic and obstructive apneic episodes can be differentiated from non-apneic episodes.

            "('This paper treats the problem of optimal selection of data quantization levels for minimum error. No assumptions are made regarding the underlying statistics of the process to be quantized. A finite precursor sample of the data is analyzed to infer the underlying distribution. Selection of optimum quantization levels can then be related to the generation of an optimum histogram for the data record. The optimum histogram is obtained by a dynamic programming approach for both least mean square error and minimum Chebychev error criteria. Transmitted data can then be quantized according to levels specified by the histogram. The process can be repeated periodically either with a new data sample, if the underlying process is nonstationary, or performed on the accumulated record in the stationary case. INTRODUCTION An important error source in digital telemetering applications arises in the quantization of analog signals prior to transmission which are to be reconstituted as analog signals upon reception. The encoding/decoding scheme, mutually agreed to by transmitter and receiver, is as follows. L Quantization intervals I1,I2,...,IL and corresponding quantization levels Q1,Q2 ...Qi , Ii, are agreed to. The intervals Ii are usually contiguous and cover the total possible range of input signal voltages x(t). At a particular sampling instant tk, the input analog signal voltage x(tk) is quantized to the level Qi corresponding to the bin interval Ii it has fallen in. The level Qi (or a symbol representation thereof) is transmitted and the receiver reconstructed signal will be based on the assumption that x(t) had value Qi at the sampling instant. Of course, an irreparable error is made and even with noiseless channels x(t) can not be reproduced with perfect fidelity at the receiver output. Up to the point of diminishing return where quantization is no greater a contributor to output error than are transmitter, channel and receiver noise, additional levels of quantization will reduce the error; but, at the expense of increased transmitted data rate. Thus, both for fidelity and data rate considerations, the choice of quantization intervals and levels is an important one and should be made under the guidance of a minimum-distortion-with-minimum-levels policy to the extent that such a criterion can be devised. For the rare case in which the stochastic signal x(t) has a known a priori probability density function (pdf) Max, reference 1, has provided an optimum solution. Here we present a method that requires no such a priori knowledge and provides additionally remarkably good estimates of tile unknown underlying pdf.

            "('Systems reliability as a measure of highway operations efficiency and effectiveness has received significant attention recently in research and literature. Several alternative definitions and measurement techniques for determining system reliability have been proposed and are being used throughout the nation. However, the profession has not universally adopted a consistent definition or application. This paper explores several of the more common definitions proposed and recommends a performance measure and technique for measuring, estimating and reporting reliability performance measures at the highway segment, facility and system level. This measure may be useful to transportation planners and engineers who perform operational analysis and provide information to travelers through ITS. A common definition for reliability is recommended based on the probability of travel times meeting users’ expectations. The definition of reliability and the application proposed in this paper is based on the principles of reliability engineering espoused by the science of operations research. Techniques for measuring and predicting systems reliability are also proposed. BACKGROUND As our nation’s highways continue to become more congested and demand increases significantly faster than our ability to expand capacity by building new facilities or adding new lane-miles to existing facilities, traditional measures of effectiveness for highway operations are becoming less meaningful. Level of service (LOS) based on the techniques of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM2000) is insufficient to describe periods of where traffic flow becomes unstable or the users’ perception of conditions when incidents such as lane closures or increased delays due to weather (poor visibility, precipitation or ice) occur. On some corridors throughout the nation, LOS of E or F are observed for eight or more hours of a typical weekday and these congestion levels are anticipated to increase and grow. In response to these congestion levels, decision makers are seeking new and better ways to describe operating conditions and the benefits of systems management applications. Concurrently, recent advances in technology and the deployment of ITS have provided new data to support research on highway operations and to manage our highway systems more effectively. The information available from intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide a strong foundation for incorporating the experience of other applications of operations research and more effectively describing the state of our nation’s highway operations. Quantitative methods for assessing these methods rely on statistical indicators commonly called performance measures or measures of effectiveness. In this context, these indicators do not need to be measured directly in the field, but rather they can be modeled or estimated using mechanistic or empirical techniques. In this paper, the term performance measure is used for any quantification of travel, either measured, modeled or estimated. PURPOSE This paper explores several of the more common definitions proposed and recommends a performance measure and technique for measuring, estimating and reporting reliability performance measures at the highway segment, facility and system level for consideration by transportation planners and engineers who perform operational analysis and provide information to travelers through ITS. PRINCIPLES OF RELIABILITY There are many definitions of reliability used by engineers and scientists for a wide range of transportation-related applications ranging from the operations and management of passenger aviation systems to logistics management. Other applications of reliability measures in industrial and electrical engineering applications are also common. Reliability is commonly reported by publications such as Consumer Reports and other trade magazines to indicate the dependability of products or services. Common to all of these definitions is the concept that the users’ (of the TRB 2003 Annual Meeting CD-ROM Paper revised from original submittal. product or service) expectations are being met. In mathematical terms, reliability, R(t), is the probability that a product or service performs adequately over the interval [0, t]. Although this definition is simple, the principle can be applied to complex systems such as power distribution, telecommunications, manufacturing of an automobile or transportation systems. The challenge in providing a common measure for highway operations is in the definition of the system boundaries or context for which it proposed. Once these boundaries are defined, mathematical models can be used to measure or extract reliability directly or to develop a combined probability theory to model, estimate or predict reliability. RELIABILITY MEASURES CURRENTLY BEING APPLIED TO HIGHWAY OPERATIONS Jackson, Shaw, Morgan, McLeod, and Vandervalk published the Florida’s Reliability Method. (Florida Department of Transportation, 2000) which included a recent survey of reliability performance measures used nationally; compared and assessed the strengths and weaknesses of reliability performance measures identified in research and through the practices of transportation agencies for planning and operations; and recommended reliability performance measures for use by the Florida Department of Transportation. The following review of alternative reliability performance measures was adapted from this report. Reliability has historically been associated with the performance of mechanical equipment or devices. In this context, reliability is defined as “the probability of a device performing its purpose adequately for the period of time intended under the stated operating conditions.” However, reliability from a transportation system perspective has been defined in different ways by different researchers. The following definitions of reliability have been documented in previous literature: • The likelihood of a traveler’s expectations being met. Reliability is measured as the variability between the expected travel time (based on scheduled or average travel time) and the actual travel time (due to the effects of non-recurrent congestion); • The range of travel times experienced during a large number of daily trips; and • The impact of non-recurrent congestion on the transportation system, estimated as a function of the variation in the duration, extent, and intensity of traffic congestion on a system. These definitions suggest that reliability is an indicator of the operational consistency of a facility over an extended period of time, measured as some function of the amount of recurrent and non-recurrent delay that occurs over that period. Just as a number of definitions are available for reliability, a wide range of techniques is reported for measuring reliability. Range of Travel Times In Measures of Effectiveness for Major Investment Studies, Turner et al. define trip time reliability as the range of travel times experienced during a large number of daily trips. The range of travel times can be obtained by calculating the mean and standard deviation of travel times within a sample. For example, an uncongested facility might have a trip time reliability of 12 to 15 minutes for 85 percent of all trips, whereas on a congested facility the reliability might be between 20 and 30 minutes. This method was used in a recent study documenting the travel time savings and reliability benefits of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes over freeway mainlines. Lomax et al. suggest that this method can be used to calculate reliability for a variety of roadway systems, including single roadways, corridors, and areawide networks. However, the range of travel times itself is not very meaningful unless it is used to make comparisons of conditions along the same facility (for example, northbound versus southbound travel, or HOV lane versus general use lane travel). The range of travel times is also based on a fixed benchmark using the 85 percentile. The result is that the proportion of unreliable travel would always stay approximately the same. For example, using the 85 percentile, approximately 15 percent of the travel time observations would always be considered unreliable, regardless of the number of observations, the value of the mean travel time, or the standard deviation of travel time. This concept is depicted in Figure 1. TRB 2003 Annual Meeting CD-ROM Paper revised from original submittal. Figure 1. Illustration Of Two-Tail Test With A Fixed Benchmark Expected value, x 7.5% of the observations will be significantly greater than the mean 85% of the observations will lie in this interval This technique also involves a two-tail test, in which unreliable conditions are considered to be those in which the travel time is either significantly better or significantly worse than average conditions. However, it is intuitive that a traveler would benefit from significantly better conditions, so unreliable conditions should be those in which travel times are significantly worse than what is expected. Thus the area of concern is the right tail of the distribution; therefore, a one-tail test is more appropriate. This concept is depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. Illustration Of A One-Tailed Test Expected value, x Area of concern Difference (variability) from expectations Total Segment Delay From Incidents Lomax et al. proposed that reliability can be measured as the difference in delay experienced on incident days versus non-incident days. Total delay is the amount of time lost due to congestion on a roadway segment and can be calculated using the following equation: Total Segment Delay (veh min) = Actual Acceptable Travel Time Travel Time (min.)

            "('The accuracy of the direct and local measurements of the heat power dissipated by the surface of the human body, using a calorimetry minisensor, is directly related to the calibration rigor of the sensor and the correct interpretation of the experimental results. For this, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the body’s local heat dissipation. When the sensor is placed on the surface of the human body, the body reacts until a steady state is reached. We propose a mathematical model that represents the rate of heat flow at a given location on the surface of a human body by the sum of a series of exponentials: W(t) = A0 + ∑Aiexp(−t/τi). In this way, transient and steady states of heat dissipation can be interpreted. This hypothesis has been tested by simulating the operation of the sensor. At the steady state, the power detected in the measurement area (4 cm2) varies depending on the sensor’s thermostat temperature, as well as the physical state of the subject. For instance, for a thermostat temperature of 24 °C, this power can vary between 100–250 mW in a healthy adult. In the transient state, two exponentials are sufficient to represent this dissipation, with 3 and 70 s being the mean values of its time constants.', 1)\n",

We construct the social network by a random graph and model the messaging activities via a multi-channel self-exciting point process. We design a methodology that divides the agents into two disjoint groups so that members within each group are considered to be of similar attributes. Our methodology and algorithm are useful for investigating and detecting abnormal activities within a network. We provide numerical illustrations based on a large email dataset from Enron. KeywordsSocial network; Multiple self-exciting point processes; Hypothesis testing; Risk mitigation. In this paper, we propose a model to estimate and analyze the structure of messaging activities in a social network. This is motivated by the recent proliferation of mobile technology, along with spread of blogs, social networking site, and media-sharing technology. For classification, detection, tracking and other practical purposes, robust statistical analysis as well as a good understanding of the data structure are essential. In this paper, we consider a collection of messaging data, made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2003, that contains highly accurate information about the time at which each message was exchanged. We introduce a meaningful way to reduce messaging data to a random graph and explore its possible application to a community detection problem. A simple and popular existing method to achieve this is to “pairwise threshold”, where for each pair of agents, an edge between vertex i and vertex j is formed if the number of messaging events between them exceeds a certain threshold. Such graphs are often thought to reveal a structure of an underlying social dynamic, motivating several successful models for a social network with sub-communities, and many tools for detecting a community with a particular graph theoretic and statistical properties have been proposed (Goldenberg et al. 2010, Kolaczyk 2009). On the other hand, some recent research (De Choudhury et al. 2010), has documented that changing the thresholds in the reduction procedure can produce dramatically different graphs, resulting in vastly dissimilar communities. This issue has motivated the work such as Heard et al. (2010) and Perry and Wolfe (2010). In both studies, as a remedy, the messaging events are modeled by way of point processes. In Heard et al. (2010), a piecewise-constant interaction rate is considered, while in Perry and Wolfe (2010) a Cox multiplicative intensity model is used with covariates that depend on the history of the process. Our approach is to model the dynamic network via n lowdimensional latent processes. One challenge to overcome is to estimate the intensity processes. Given an estimate of the intensity processes, we propose a novel embedding methodology to facilitate inference. Based on our methodology, we can produce a random graph with a particular probabilistic structure that could be very useful for the purpose of community detection. I.

Collectively, d` = (τ`, {i`, j`}, k`) represents the `-th messaging event. We require that τ` k2. For each (undirected) pair ij of the vertices and t ∈ [0, T ], we denote by Nij,k(t) the number of (undirected) messaging events on the topic k. between vertex i and vertex j during [0, t]. For each t ∈ [0, T ], let Dk(t) be the collection of all communication messaging events by time t on topic label k, i.e., Dk(t) = { (τk,`, {ik,`, jk,`}, k) : ` = 1, . . . , ∑', 3)\n",
            "('This paper presents a fault-tolerant (FT) switching control system structure and proposes an FT controller design methodology for systems vulnerable to actuator and sensor faults. The working effectiveness of the i-th actuator/sensor (which is assumed to be known) is represented as a time varying parameter δ<inf>i</inf>(t) where δ<inf>i</inf>(t) ∈ {0, c<inf>2</inf>, …, c<inf>s−1</inf>, 1} and where δ<inf>i</inf>(t) = 0 represents a component failure at time t while δ<inf>i</inf>(t) = c<inf>j</inf>, for j = 2, …, s − 1 (cf. δ<inf>i</inf>(t) = 1) represents a partially (cf. fully) working component. If the total number of components is m, then at any time t, there are s<sup>m</sup> fault scenarios. Recognizing that it is unlikely that all components will have serious faults at the same time, the design objective is to maintain an acceptable level of closed-loop performance only for those fault scenarios for which the minimum sum of working effectiveness of all components is assumed to be p, where 0 ≤ p ≤ m, so that p defines a fault-tolerance level for the controller. At the same time, the no-fault nominal performance is optimized. The FT controller is reconfigurable, but with the special structure that the system matrices are fixed while the switching is on the time varying parameters δ<inf>i</inf>(t), i = 1, …, m. For systems with many potential component fault cases, a semidefinite relaxation FT control design procedure is proposed so as to overcome the combinatorial nature of the problem. A numerical example is given in the last section to demonstrate the efficiency of the FT controller design.', 6)\n",
