# DataScienceCapstone

This repository contains two notebooks demonstrating code for my data science capstone (Fall 2023). Our project's research question was "What is the relationship between presentational factors of computer science (CS) paper abstracts and their success?". Presentational factors are aspects of how a paper is presented that are within a writer's control. CS paper success was defined as the number of citations a CS paper received from other CS papers within 5 years of publication. I was responsible for investigating two presentational factors: positive language and mathematical content. Our hypothetical audience for this paper was researchers, especially those just starting out, with the end goal of making them aware of "the implicit presentational criteria that will affect their future career opportunities" (quote taken from my group's paper summarizing our capstone project).

"Math Content Debugging" demonstrates code I used to evaluate the method I was using to calculate abstracts' mathematical content, and "Length-Standardized Positive Words ChatGPT" demonstrates code I used to make a visualization that was put on our final paper for the capstone. I may put more of the notebooks I made for the capstone here, but I believe these two are representative of the most important (and most-related to data science) work I did for the project.
